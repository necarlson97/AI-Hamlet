todo:
	need to figure out the psychology metrics. Happiness vs sadness? Order vs chaos?
	Perhaps for now we have the following spectrum (each is actually a 0-1 number, but we break
	it down to these tags for simplicity)
		* 'happiness' = joyful vs content vs miserable
		* 'socability' = bonded vs aquanted vs isolated
		* 'hygiene' = clean vs tidy vs filthy
		* 'order' = opressed vs regulated vs chaotic 
		
	Then these have a chance to trigger binary good/bad states:
		* pregnant (create new person in 280 days) = joyful or content, bonded
		* vaccation (skip work, +socability, -order) = joyful
		* play hookey (skip work, +hapiness) = miserable, regulated or chaotic
		* contagious (skip work) = tidy or filthy, aquanted or socable
		* deathly sick (die) = filthy, aquanted or isolated
		* home injury (skip work) = tidy or filthy, aquanted or isolated
		* mortal accedent (die) = isolated, tidy or filthy
		* temper tantrum (fight others for a day) = miserable, aquanted or isolated, regulated or chaotic
		* sociopathic break (fight others until dead) = miserable, isolated

Longer term:
	Skybox:
		would be cool to use something like Spacescape for night, then somethng for
		day, and use curves to blend between them

	Diagetic viewing:
		would be cool if viewing was done 'manually' as the king or ambassator or something,
		or even through like birds that fly overhead, or animals in the woods - that kind of thing
